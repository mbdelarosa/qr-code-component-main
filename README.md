Through this challenge, I was able to learn the following concepts:
- CSS Reset
- Use of `rem` for `font-size` instead of `px`
- Mobile-first development
- HTML5 Landmarks
- Use of flex properties to center elements

### Continued development

In future projects, I'd like to continue my learning and application of the following:

- HTML5 Markup
- Best practices in frontend development

### Useful resources

- [Accessible Landmarks | scottohara.me](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html) - This gave a good introduction on what HTML5 landmarks are, providing use cases and examples that are really helpful
- [Should I change the default HTML font-size to 62.5%? - FED Mentor](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/rem-html-font-size-hack/) - This was really insightful on when and how to use `rem` instead of `px`, as well as providing additional techniques to make this conversion easier
- For the CSS reset, the following resources proved to be very helpful:
  - [A Modern CSS Reset - Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/)
  - [Modern CSS Reset / Global Styles](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
